An important step before beginning work on any project is to make sure that your machine is configured in a format that you find easy to use.  As an example of what I mean by this, we will be doing some work jumping back and forth between the XCode window, Gameplan, and probably an internet browser window.  Instead of constantly rearranging the windows, MAC's use spaces to allow quick changes.  To create a new space, press CTRL+UP ARROW.  Then, mouse over to the top right corner and click the + to add a new space.  Place gameplan in one space, Xcode in another, and your browser in another.  Now, you can quickly switch between these with CTRL+LEFT/RIGHT ARROW.
